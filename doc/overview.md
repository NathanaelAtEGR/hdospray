## OSPRay for Hydra

OSPRay for Hydra (hdOSPRay) is an open source plugin for Pixar's USD to extend the Hydra
rendering framework with [Intel&reg; OSPRay](https://www.ospray.org). HdOSPRay
enables interactive, path traced rendering by utilizing OSPRay's renderers
and [Intel&reg; Open Image Denoise](http://openimagedenoise.org).  OSPRay for Hydra and OSPRay are released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

As part of the [Intel oneAPI Rendering
Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/rendering-framework), OSPRay is
highly-optimized for Intel&reg; CPU architectures ranging from laptops to
large-scale distributed HPC systems. HdOSPRay leverages the Intel&reg;
Rendering Framework to deliver interactive rendering for large-scale models at
high levels of fidelity, as demonstrated at SIGGRAPH 2018 using over [100GB of
production
assets](https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/intel-open-source-libraries-hollywood).

### Support and Contact

HdOSPRay is still in beta, with new features and existing issues being worked
on regularly.  USD is also under active development and is often fast changing.
We tag the HdOSPRay releases to match specified USD releases, but cannot always
anticipate all of the changes and resulting issues for users.  Please report
any issues you may run into to our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/ospray/hdospray/issues).  We always welcome
suggestions and especially pull requests!
